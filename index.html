            <p>
                Mobile technology has had a profound impact on Uganda, with mobile phones now an essential tool for communication and business. Over 20 million Ugandans use mobile phones, and services like mobile money have made banking accessible to those without traditional bank accounts. Services such as MTN Mobile Money and Airtel Money enable people to make payments, transfer funds, and save money, even in rural areas.

            <img src="https://example.com/digital-uganda-challenges.jpg" alt="Challenges of Digital Growth in Uganda" class="article-image">
            <p>
                While the tech landscape in Uganda is growing, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed. Limited internet access, especially in rural areas, hinders the ability of many Ugandans to benefit from digital technologies. Additionally, there is a need for more digital literacy programs to equip people with the skills needed to leverage these technologies fully.

            <p>
                The future of technology in Uganda looks promising, with ongoing efforts to improve infrastructure and invest in education. As more young Ugandans embrace technology, the potential for growth in the tech sector is enormous. With a focus on innovation and increased access to digital tools, Uganda could become a leader in East Africa's technology-driven economy.
